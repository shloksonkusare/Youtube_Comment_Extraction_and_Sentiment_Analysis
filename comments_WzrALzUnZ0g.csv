I'm 17 and i decided to learn
"too much jargon,
too little information"
"two of my favorites! i love Robert Green, i heard this in his own channel,"
I'm just 19 and this is so damn hard man
His voice keeps cracking quiet distracting
"Ive spent the last 40+ years trying to be a person that others would approve of or be proud of.  I am learning now to be a person that I am proud of and spending my time, thoughts and energy on things I enjoy for me.  It truly changes your perspective when you dont worry or care about what others think of your journey but what you think of it."
"Wow, I love that. When your emotionally engaged, you have the discipline to focus and learn something."
"2:16  
Today's date: 16 October 2025

I am 17yr old currently preparing (not seriously becoz I hat not studied for last two months) for JEE examination but I  am confused. I can get distracted by small stimulus. I am unable to concentrate on one single task for long time. I feel directionless despite have a goal.
But I promise myself that I will findy purpose in life and live according to it.

If someone is reading my comment please like it so that It remind me"
"I have found my purpose, I will be a great mom and a wonderful wife. ❤"
My purpose is to pose like u
"I always wished I had ONE thing that stood out. Like I picked up a guitar and just shredded. Or like u i knew I loved a subject like science. I played our organ a lot by ear and sports as a kid. Loved riding my bike and nature. It’s always been like I’m sort of good at a handful of things but master of none. Nothing useful anyway. I love to help people just don’t know how. I do enjoy being creative but am too much of a perfectionist to let myself be good. Found out I have ADHD at 40. So it kind of makes sense I guess. I run out of dopamine so I can’t perfect anything anymore. So what about people with adhd. What can be their life’s purpose? I feel like if it doesn’t come easy, I get bored with it and move on. Please help. I was really good at sports as a kid and did graphic design which I loved but now I think I’m aging out of it. I’m a mom of two and still feel like something is missing. ❤"
"I have never had a “purpose”, never worried about my “purpose”, and never felt sad about not having a “purpose”. Sounds like I have avoided a ton of grief and anxiety."
Having a purpose and the feeling of gratitude are the greatest gifts in life.  So far 0 for 2.
"I’m 57. I’m a musician an artist and a lifelong restaurant worker  
I was sad to hear that it may be too late to find my purpose. I don’t know if I will. How depressing.  I have a pretty good life but I don’t think I’ll ever know a purpose really"
I was fascinated by everything I loved a lot of things how do I know which one is my true passion😅
"I'm 47, I just realized as I said that out loud, it's my birthday. I think I m gonna make music although I sometimes don't feel inspired enough. I have this disdain for ""other"" people. It makes me not give a shit. Ha ha ha!!! Funny honey I honestly don't think it matters if you do anything or not. Like it's fine but it doesn't matter. No guilt just being alive."

"During Covid I sold my house and built a little organic fruit farm in Costa Rica. I also bought 300 gallons of red wine! Haha
Kicked my alcoholism into overdrive and lost my way. I recently did Ibogaine 5MEO DMT to cure my addiction. I am o e year sober and retiring at 54. Moving down to my farm and I finally have my purpose back! I want to build this farm, share my food with neighbors and the local church’s. I have community and my soul back! Follow your heart and the mind will follow! 
I don’t have any money but a monthly check from my company. I am richer now and have never felt better!
Pura Vida everyone, go live and find your path!
❤️🍀🇨🇷🚀"
"I'm 25 years old now , I don't know what I'm doing I had my degree in civil engineering but I wasn't interested in it so I drop it and started learning graphic designing and working in a printing house but still I m not feeling well so I'm gonna start a new career as an car mechanic cause I think if we don't know what are doing try everything you could until i find interesting..."
"When I was a child, when my mom told me to practice handwriting, I always ended up drawing squares then fill them with different colors. Colors have always been gratifying to me. I must explore this inner calling. 35 might be a bit too late but better late than never."
"What really blows my mind is how little curiosity people have when it comes to manifestation and the deeper mechanics behind it. Most folks are satisfied with the recycled 'think positive and visualize' narrative — which, sure, has its place — but that’s just the surface. There’s a whole architecture of laws and principles underneath that most never even touch. The fact that so few have heard of Luna Rivers, someone who spent years decoding this hidden structure and laid it all out in Manifest the Unseen, says everything. People aren’t necessarily lacking potential — they’re just not willing to question beyond the obvious. And that comfort zone? It’s costing them their freedom.💰✨"
It is unfortunate that so many children and teenagers receive poor parenting. Finding purpose is much more likely when kids are trained by loving parents who are kind and firm.
"As a muslim there is ultimate goal and there is a life path , this is were we sometimes struggle with waht we ganna work, what to sturdy etc."
"Mr Greene is not wrong and finding your purpose in life is truly incredible. The advice I would give is ask yourself what would you jump out of bed in the morning for with a smile on your face? What makes you happy because there is something that makes all of us happy and if that gives you no answers what are your hobbies? What do you like to do and can you earn a living off it?  
I spent all my life wondering what my purpose was, chasing a pound note yet it was right in front of me all the time - helping people and books. 15 months ago (aged 43) I began writing a book on the mind and the brain and have since  found my purpose. I’ve recently set up my own company, about to launch the first book and plan 2 more books this year. I’ve not only found my purpose but have a vision, clarity and ridiculous desire to succeed. 
Only you know what your true purpose is and the challenge is to find it and unleash it. Don’t worry about age as a lot of guys find their purpose in their 40’s/50’s."
The answer was not given nice
What do you do if you've never found that thing that makes you tick?
So basically it’s a process of elimination
Everything has a purpose
i'm almost 50. i hate myself. i hate the society humans built. it is so hard to exist in this. finding purpose feels like a bad joke.
I'm 42 years old and so lost I can't seem to figure it out. Some people are saying just to force yourself in a Direction. But at my age I feel like I'm running out of time and I need to make money somehow
Holy shit this guy is so wise.
amazing value.. must watch
"You don’t need another trick, another method or another ''secret''. What you really need is clarity, a moment of truth that cuts through all the noise and finally makes things make sense. Something that quiets your mind so you can see what’s been right in front of you all along. I say this because I’ve lived it. I was stuck, confused and constantly searching. And it wasn't until I came across a book called Cosmic Attravia that something shifted inside me. I’m not here to hype it up or convince anyone. That’s not my intention, but I can’t stay silent either. Because for me, this book alongside the right mindset was a turning point for me and I wish it does the same thing for you. I don’t usually comment on videos like this, but if you’re reading this, maybe it’s for a reason. Don’t ignore this. Sometimes all it takes is one piece of insight to completely change your life. Wishing you peace, clarity and alignment. ✨"
"A tip that changed everything for me: stop forcing, start aligning. A book Cosmic Attravia by Pagizo helped me understand how to be instead of constantly do. That shift alone brought more clarity than years of trying."
Very useful thanks for sharing it
"as i child or as a teenager sometimes we doesn't know difference between the addictions and proper goals i used to get addicted to video games and thought after going to university i will give my full but later after a year i came to know that's not my field coz i started to hate it after my addiction towards started to end , i still regret it i forget i lost my skills to study or i can say i lost my focus , now i am wanderering here and there to find my goal but in my childhood even now i love watching films , i feel good , i can work with them for hours i like fiction , i like stories .So can i choose it as my goal i am stuck to make a choice between studies (i loved maths a lot , i like research )  and  movies can anyone guide me i am stressed a lot please"
"Okay so in summary:

""Find what makes you unique and figure Out how to make a living with it."""
Thanks for the truth you guys have shared😇
"Teachers talk like there are only Doctors, Lawyers, and Burger Flippers. There are so many jobs you've never heard of out there. So Many kinds of Technicians. Teachers told me I'd never get a job staring out a window but I've had many jobs doing that. Security and Diriving mostly. America runs on the unseen service of drivers. Although I did decide to start honing the skills for customer service immediately, there are many jobs that won't really need much beyond not being a jerk."
"2:04

Tragedy of my life. My childhood gave me complex trauma and i am absolutely Not Sure what that special something is. Even after 8+ month's of therapy and several years of trying different jobs etc."
"Dr Huberman, psychology (mental health) would be probably of the most important topic you could discuss. I feel without mental strength you really can't do anything else. I know this firsthand. Can you please please bring more psychologist on your show to talk about ie) depression, anxiety, addictions etc"
"Oh yippie, another idea that focuses on the childhood. Ysee I suffer from a condition called “Literally 1 memory before the age of 11” making most of this advice feel very… useless. I’m 16, I’m in college, and I have… nothing. I don’t want to be here, I just don’t want much of anything. I just don’t at all, and it’s exhausting."
"I felt so drained and tired everday. I tried everything, preworkouts, youtube gurus, morning routines that nearly killed me. none of it hit. then i saw someone mention Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks in the comments and it literally changed my life. Following everything in that book past couple of weeks made me realize I was running on empty for YEARS. wish I knew about this years ago🔥"
"not gonna lie, i felt numb for months. like i was just surviving, not really living. then someone dropped Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks in a yt comment and i gave it a shot. bro… this book gave me my edge back. not by yelling at me to hustle, but by showing me how to fix my foundation. life hits different now."
"If you’ve been wondering why you’re not feeling as strong, motivated, or sharp as you used to, Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks might just have the answers. The book focuses on the power of testosterone and how increasing it can seriously transform your health and mindset. If you’re tired of feeling drained or out of balance, this book offers some solid advice on how to get back to your peak"

"dont have a nose for cooking, eyes for desing, ears for music, mouth for words or body for sports... i tryied all of that, none worked... masters degree in marketing in europe, can pilot a plane, used to do mma, none worked... and in my work they asked my ""what do you like to do?, what do you want to do?, how can you improve the bussiness?"".... and i still dont know"

"I agree with this but I also think we should all consider that some people don’t just find purpose in a job. You can find purpose in being a loving father, mother, son, etc. Maybe it’s god. You can find purpose with knitting or drawing pictures. We can’t just put value on professions."
"To anyone who's suffering depression, anxiety, insomnia and other mental health problems, you are not alone. I feel you. You are so brave. You are doing so well. I'm proud of you.

The anxiety that used to control my whole day barely shows up now!🙏❤"
awesome 💫
"It’s honestly fascinating how much of the world operates on principles most people never even hear about. I’m not talking conspiracy stuff — I mean the subtle, structured laws that seem to quietly govern influence, timing, energy, and decision-making. The kind of knowledge that’s been passed around quietly in elite circles for generations, while the rest of the world is busy arguing over surface-level distractions. I recently discovered Owen Hermsting, someone who clearly didn’t just study this material — he lived it. His ebook, The Law Behind the Laws, goes deep into these patterns without sounding preachy or overly mystical. It’s one of the few books I’ve read that actually connects the dots between ancient systems, modern psychology, and the way power really works. It’s not flashy or trending on social media, but honestly, that might be the best thing about it."
"am I the only one who didn’t get it? I certainly don’t remember what I was into when I was 5 and other than that, what was the message? this is probably why I haven’t found my purpose yet, the universe is probably speaking like this and all I want is one clear explanation"
"40, disabled and have no clue what to do with myself but smoke weed and play video games 😢"
Thank you guys
At some level you have to be accepted by others to be in any field of work. You can follow what you dream of doing but that doesnt get you hired. You could be the best but that doesnt get you hired. The dilemma is societies belief that you can do the thing you want. What then? It's so hard to get hired. If we've changed careers multiple times get multiple degrees and still cant find our place all weve done is dig a finacial hole that will interfere with everything you two are saying. What then? Please help.

"I'm so glad I found Andrew Huberman and all of his channels, because they have helped me feel so understood in so many ways, physiologically, mentally, chemically, emotionally, etc. 

One thing I really resonated with (amongst many topics in this episode) was when Andrew was talking about being kinesthetically tuned (14:06), and how some people experience their thoughts through a patchwork of sensation in the body. I have never in my life been able to identify with something more than that distinction/framework of thought processing. Coming to the conclusion that not everyone experiences the sensation of thoughts within the body is groundbreaking for me because I genuinely believed that everyone did. I now realize the reason why I frequently get frustrated when I try to learn new things using an intellectual framework and fail miserably or just struggle to understand in general is because my brain does not retain information through thought-connection, but rather thought-sensation-connection. 

For example, for me, I can read/research a subject as much as I want, but the content of that research will not 'click' or be retained in my brain until I reach a point where I physically feel or am able to identify a specific concept with a particular sensation. It's like all my 'Aha!' moments have to be accompanied by a degree of sensation or associated with a degree of emotion before I can actually begin to understand what I'm learning about. Or another example, I often use music (various genres) to understand concepts I can't understand through reading, by paying attention to the potential shifts in vibration/patterns within the melody and how they contribute to the overall emotional expression/message of the song through lyrics. It's given me so much insight, I never would have known that kinesthetically tuned even existed as a term that describes thought processes had I not taken the time to explore an episode like this one. But now I can find new ways to process information/learn that work for my type of thought process. Like I said before, GROUNDBREAKING. 

Andrew, you are a godsend. Keep up the good work because you're helping so many people come to conclusions retrospectively that they probably would have never been able to reach without watching you discuss it publicly and civilly in the same gracious and intellectual way you do. Thank you."
"I love my dad, and i know that he loves me too, but in my childhood, his ideals and goals about me ruined me, at the end i become a goalless, lost guy who does not know what to do. I can't even pursue anything i've started, i bore quickly, can't do nothing, can't even give effort. Hope i can be fixed."
"great discussion, thanks"
Need clarification. Which Howard Gardner book is book is referenced? “Five Minds For the Future” or “Frames of Mind”?
The hardest part is that most people have a hard time monetizing their purpose.

"I hate when a journalist focuses on himself instead of the guest .
Why he tires us with his life"
"I'd be interested to hear what types of questions I could be asking myself in order to reconnect to my younger self that Robert speaks about. This video changed the way I've been seeing things and everything he said made so much sense, it actually made me cry. It was such a release. After hearing the generic ""life is what you make it"" or ""take one fay at a time"" or ""find joy in the mundane ""... this was a breath of fresh air. While all those things might be true, what I'm searching for is much deeper than that. I need to dig into who I am. WHY am I not finding the joy in life right now. I know there are several reasons that can contribute, but man... he nailed it. I've lost my guide inside my head. All these external pressures and people and distractions really get in the way. I need to find my way back. Who I am outside of the world's expectations?"
"I am trying to discover my talents, but is not easy to find it, I would like to get some guidance to find those talents or my mission in life. I need to have an assessment to find my strengths and weakness. I haven't found my passion yet and that is giving me frustration. I was not a really social person a kid not even at school, I am good on solving problems, organizing, hands on, initiatives, analytic, like technology, build stuff. what would you recommend seeking as a career?"
Bro just understood childhood/education traits from ck3 🧠
"I seriously want help in this! I'm 32 and I wasted my career track I my 20s. I went to school for music because it's all I knew I was good at. I'm an industrial engineer now with a good job that I don't hate. But I am a people person. My greatest help to any company is relationships not numbers. I'm competent at work but I know I'm never going to be an expert, and I'm not using what comes naturally. I'm more and more afraid I'm missing my potential."
"When we follow our passion and when we need to earn through it,
It may put stress on us, and we need to  forcefully do that work for long time,  and it may lead us to hating that work we were doing out of passion.



Or is  there anything else  that happens?"

Do a pod cast on that …?"
"When I was a kid I loved bmx bikes, and guitar.  I thought native americans were cool for living off the land.  I thought puppies were cute and was into disco/funk.  As an adult I play guitar very well, expert biker, and still like funk.  Live alone with my dog.  i’ve been lost for my whole life in terms of a career.  I’m kinda ADD and can not focus on office work.  I’m ambitious and hard working but everybody thinks I’m a bum.  If I found my thing I’d work really damn hard.  But wtf do you do with guitar skills and biking skills? Sorry world I wasn’t a nerd 8 year old studying history"
another Damn good episode.
This was my path. In high school I learned Horticulture and grew a square garden then grew many at home. Grew some marijuana because they sold seeds. Next thing I knew I was growing a few to many with the wrong “friends” as my contact. Bam next thing you know I was facing 5 years while in debt…
The fact that nobody talks about forbidden books on Revandles is so insanee
"Alhamdulillah, as a Muslim, I know my purpose in life. We read the Al-Qur'an and live as we are supposed to live. The Al-Qur'an and Sunnah are like a manual book written by the Creator, who made you and knows you better than yourself - Adz Dzariyat:56 (وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ) -"

"Life is torture and suffering. The way i see it, the way i feel it, i dont belong here and have never fit in. I just need to keep making money to keep me afloat and leave this joint as soon as possible. That is my purpose."
Can anyone tell me  I have made a purpose in life but forget about that everytime what to do .... how to do the work while remembering them
The silence around Revandles' forbidden books is actually wild.
It's crazy how no one ever brings up the forbidden books on Revandles
The fact that no one mentions forbidden books on Revandles is actually criminal.
Why is no one talking about the forbidden books on Revandles? It’s literally insane!
Not enough people are talking about the forbidden books on Revandles and I’m losing it.

"I'm 75 and always 'followed my heart'. Yes, ups and downs along the way but as I come closer to leaving my body, I am 100% content and as happy as I can be. I have purpose and as a result of who I am, am surrounded by people who love me."
This is called brain jamming finding purpose one says the another says dont both right  irrational exuberance of life❤❤🎉🎉
"At a crossroads at 37, wondering where to go from here."
"I think that you have to hit rock bottom mentally to really start to question everything and find your purpose. I started being curious and follow those things that put me in a flow-state. I think that is a very big key to ”knowing” what to do with your life that’s not really mentioned in this video. Also I think many are too comfortable and are too weak to do the work needed because they lack willpower and drive. I think this is because they chose to go the easy route, that’s not fulfilling."
"Man I’m 36, a few years ago I rediscovered my passion for illustration. I took a few classes online then at a university for about two semesters then moved to TX hoping to find better opportunities. Right now I yearn for a solid job doing this kind of creative work, building up a project like a film or video game. I don’t have much experience but I know I can do this job, and I’d do it in my sleep. But unfortunately it’s not a way to pay bills at the moment, and my gf has been pushing me to go the IT route. Its rough man, knowing what I’m driven to do, what I love to do, but unable to really strive at it for the sake of financial security"
So.. How to find it? =)
"I’m 48, married 25 years, 2 kids and a grandson. Been working in the same shop for 20 years. We live well but I still feel like I have not found MY thing. Not sure if I ever would but I’ll keep looking."

"i am 48 years old. I left corporate 5 years ago and went on a journey to discover what i wanted. i had so many experiences with what i didn't want. and the last 5 years have been TOUGH because there has been no shining star in the sky leading me to this thing i want. i know what i want my life to look like but i don't know the how. it IS a journey and i continue each day to digest material like this to try to learn how to create a self-determining life and make money doing it without feeling like i am selling off my autonomy and self-determination to someone else or some system. Sometimes i get anxious that I am too old to start anew like this and to be figuring things out. but, no choice but to keep searching. I know others feel like this too."
"5:15, i can relate so much"
Where can i see the full episode
I love listening to this great mind.

the purpose of life is to experience it to experience existence
"People should love everyone, including our enemies God calling us to be neighbors to our enemies this reminds us we are to love our enemies and pray for them who persecute us... Amen."
This man is a blessing in a very confusing time. He deserves all the praise in the world for his efforts and accurate insights into human behavior.
"i’m a 40 year old lawyer that chose the profession because of the money and prestige. i’m sad, very very sad. everyday."
yeah but what if i can't remember myself before the age of 12-13
I believe you can reset your mind without beeing  restricted by age! Emotional intelligence is the top of experience which allows us to connect to our higher selves&everything else that shares the spark of life/light.Every set intention and spoken word create reality in a blink of an eye! There is a gap in between that has to be  understood and valued and it has to do with each person's identity!
"And what if i dont have memories from my 4-10? And my family doesn't have a clue about it too😂 really, now what?"
"Summary
This transcript features a discussion between Robert Greene and Dr. Andrew Huberman on the process of finding one's life purpose. The speakers emphasize the importance of focusing on inner voices, interests, and talents from childhood. They highlight how passions felt in early years shape career choices in adulthood and how losing touch with this internal compass becomes more difficult with age. They advocate for a personal and almost archaeological approach to uncovering childhood clues, suggesting that finding one's unique path is possible. They also point out that energy derived from both what we love and what we hate plays a significant role in discovering our life purpose.

Key Points
👶 Childhood inner voices: Recalling your childhood interests and talents is a crucial step in finding your life purpose. These inner voices may align with the different types of intelligence discussed in Howard Gardner’s Five Frames of Mind.

🧭 Discovering your uniqueness: Every individual has a unique DNA structure and set of experiences. Discovering this uniqueness and transforming it into a career path is the key to finding your life purpose.

✨ Emotional connection: Passion for a subject accelerates learning and makes overcoming challenges easier. When you engage in something you truly love, even discipline and mundane tasks become more manageable.

💔 Learning from wrong paths: Lessons can also be drawn from things you hate. However, this should not lead to a general disdain for learning and discipline. Both positive and negative experiences can help you find your life purpose.

🌱 A continuous quest: Finding your life purpose is not an instant process but a continuous journey of discovery and experience. It is possible to find this purpose even in your 30s or 40s; what matters is maintaining the effort to uncover your uniqueness."
You have to find your life task...👌🏻
"Many successful ones like Steve Jobs, etc. always mentioned YOUR PASSION !!!. Listening to greene here it very confusing, too complicated. It took me over 50 years to KNOW, but I was DOING IT FOR 50 years though. Anyway, it what Deepak say, we have a AUTHENTIC, SOUL SELF !!! BUT that SELF we know was CREATED BY OTHERS (really tragic, usually parents) and not SELF created by oneself.  I realized your TRUE SELF, which has a divine purpose was designed  IN YOU when you were CREATED, for me I learned, LOOK AT WHAT YOU BEEN DOING YOUR WHOLE LIFE LONG !!!! since you were 6 YEARS OLD !!!! For me it was DONATING a dime to the March of Dime for cripple children when  I was getting my polio vaccine from school nurse.  Over 50 years of adulthood, many traumas, many failures, no dream fullfilled, medical career a disasters, many cancer patients died, lupus patients had relapsed, etc. ,BUT I kept supporting fundraisers for kidney foundation, sponsors triathlon, sponsor diabetes fundraisers, disabled children fundraiser, sponsor hospital residency fundraiser etc.  THEY WERE ALL SIDELINE VOLUNTEER work, 
Put simply IT WHAT YOU DO NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS !!!! cause it YOU, simple the SUN SHINE, that the way it is !!!!"
nice
Your parent's play a big role
What if you don't need or want a purpose in life.

"Yea my parents always said.."" pay your bills ! Pay your taxes!"" I never agreed to that !!!!😢"
"""Glimmers of Gratitude"" ---- my favourite phrase"
"I have listened to numerous Andrew Huberman podcasts and they were very insightful particularly a layman like me who has no idea about neuroscience for example one podcast explained about neuroplasticity and consistency in habits can rewire the brain for better focus and learning. Thank you so much Dr.Andrew Huberman for all the teachings , you make it simple. Lots of love"
"This is soo soo true that ""when you are emotionally engages with the subject you learn faster and retains in the memory forever"". which is again the Brain optimizes the learning mechanism."
"""WOW"""
where to watch full episode?
"Praise that they’re not touching astrology. That guy is probably a Pisces, which is why he’s obsessed with water and fish. How sad that they’re leaving 80% of the story out. Just so they don’t offend anybody that astrology is so real what is sad sad sad sad"
I am here because lately I am unmotivated and dunno what to do to my life anymore.

"I started a Saturday morning with this video, eyes closed. 
Beautiful, beautiful conversation. Thank you!"
"I worked without real passion now I’m retired don’t have to make money ,and do what I love ❤️"
This video is a great reminder that finding your purpose starts with self-reflection and embracing your passions. It's about exploring what truly excites you and taking small steps toward it. Thanks you !
I’m glad I came across this
70+ still drifting
Meditate and set the intention to gain insights into finding your best path. Best of luck😊
How can you find it? I can't find it since years! :(
Who were you before the world told you what to be?
This man's very knowledgeable
Wise man
Hey what is the book he recommended to read on this video?
"this has given me so much to think about, thanks so much for this!!"
"1)ask questions 
2)speak your truth 

That’s it.."
Use this podcast if you wanna find your purpose in life and if you wanna find purpose of life not just in life go search the final revelation of Creator of life book Quran. And truth shall make you happy and free amen.
Really interesting and TRUE

"22 y.o. here... I know I want to do arts, but people are against me going that path bc office work and similar things earn more. But I feel like I'm wasting my life doing office work. I don't wanna waste my life, but I'm afraid I won't succeed if I follow what I want instead of what people say is the way to success."
I’m 22 years old and I still haven’t found out what i want to do.  I really don’t wanna waste my life
"This was such an interesting episode. I am 64, I recognised when Robert mentioned that being forced to study things that you hated could cause aversion to future need for discipline and study skills..and I feel this may be a reason why I grew up 'failing"" despite really wanting to do certain things. I love people, communication, improving, educating...but hate education systems. Have lived as a serial procrastinator, frustrated to always feel I was sucked onto a wrong path to please orhers .  At 60 I decided I'd had enough of the norm and started learning to build my own online business, which helps others do they same.  I love being able to help, communicate but the learning discipline has been a barrier...I do 101 things to avoid and distract.  I would love some advice if anyone resonates, because I really would love to embrace to pleasure of the passion ...without the critic in my head"
"I dont feel discontent at all. I feel purposeful and full of life. I dont keep checking how i feel but i do care for the people around me and that makes me happy. Ive been poor, im ok now. Scenarios are temporary. They are little life puzzles. Welcome each one. At the end of solving many of them, all we really need is to give love and allow love in. If u cant find a spouse, try dating a completely different kind of person. Its all just a pile of puzzles."
One could listen to this or watch Steve Martin's portrayal in the Jerk
Knowing about Dr Huberman's early love of animals helps explain his compassion in his video on grief where he included loss of a pet equal to loss of a human
"A simple and much important question when we wake up in every moring/days/weeks/months/years

"People obfuscate this path on purpose. Wanted to be a 911 operator. Told I was to dumb, my hair was not right, my attitude wasn’t nice when I was called by the wrong name, told I could dress myself correctly.

I could listen to these guys all day
Thank you.
"I do feel, something that is worth mentioning or was worth mentioning here, is that people focus on equating their ""Purpose"" with a career or something they can make money from. Where in business and finance I have been fortunate in being successful but still felt there was something missing. I found my purpose in my son when I became a father 2 years ago. Nothing has ever fulfilled me more in life than being a dad and giving him my presence in a way my father never gave me"
"They didn't discuss how to find your purpose in life, just the benefits of it, pathetic title to mislead people"
"I would love to see the world in a hundred years once the next few generations have learned to listen to their inner voices and grow their sense of purpose while the world around them had adjusted to embrace the intrinsically human intuitions and emotions that AI is incapable of inputting and outputting. 

People underestimate others and the will of the human spirit.

The kind of inner work you cannot get paid for is the kind that will radically improve the world. Imho."
"I’m 34, married to the most amazing man and we have two beautiful kiddos together that are 8 and 13.
I’ve had so many interests throughout my life & I didn’t go to college because I didn’t know what I wanted to do when I grew up. I still don’t honestly lol. My husband is also military so we’ve moved a LOT! And I’ve had to “start over” each time. I’ve enjoyed my jobs for the most part, but they’ve all just been “jobs” that don’t pay very well at all. 
I want & know that I can make a lot more money, and contribute a lot more financially. But I definitely feel stuck because I still am not 100% sure as to what I want to do.

 I do however love fitness. I was a PT about 6 years ago but it was very scary for me because I was a “textbook” trainer. It was so much more in depth when on the gym floor with clients. I ended up quitting because I didn’t feel qualified enough to truly train people. But I love helping people feel better about themselves. I also thought about, while listening to this video, when I was a kid I loved to play. All kinds of sports, I taught myself to rollerblade & developed skills with my soccer or running and bike riding. I was very active & adventurous. So I think that might be my “calling”. But it’s also so saturated and I don’t have an interest in being an “influencer” at all. But being there for my family is #1. I also want to be able to contribute financially & to society. I’m just lost & not very confident in myself I suppose. So I don’t know what to do. 

If you’re still reading this, thank you! Lol😊"
"you must also read the kindle book ""The Death of Your Hindrances: The Birth of Your Success Through Enchanting Affirmations"""
"When you're interested your brain learns 2x 3x 4x faster. That clicked! Same as ""pushing through boring stuff""."
This was less about how to and more about the concept of finding a purpose.
"Analogy... if a person decides to create or buy something, that something must SERVE him/her first before sharing it with others... the same analogy... God created/made our LIFE to SERVE God first before we can serve our life with others.... ""WHATEVER YOU DO PUT GOD FIRST."" ...(ref. Proverbs 3:6)... Praise be to God in Christ Jesus... Amen."
"Analogy... when a person creates or buys something, for example, a CHAIR, it must serve the person who created or bought the Chair the purpose of SITTING on it...if the Chair is broken and loses the purpose to sit on, then, what good is that to the one who created or bought the Chair?... NONE... either fix it or throw it on the dumpsite.

The same analogy... God created Mankind to LIVE by serving the Living God/YHWH with their purpose of DOING the WILL (Prerogatives) of the creator/maker (God)... When you lose your purpose by staying away from God and not doing God's Will, what good are you to your maker/creator... NONE... you are just a piece of JUNK, a useless person in God's Sight... either you come back to God as a PRODICAL SON, or be thrown in the Eternal Condemnation of Fire (Suffering) in Hell... 

""What good is the SALT if it loses its' SALTINESS? ...no longer good for anything, neither for flavoring nor for preserving, except to be thrown."" (ref. Matt. 5:13-14). 

Take Note:... The Make/Creator (God) has ALL the RIGHT, POWER, and AUTHORITY to do ALL that PLEASES Him (God)... 
Facts and Truth of the Matter, Biblically and Logically speaking... Praise be to God in Christ Jesus... Amen."
still doesnt tell me how to find MY purpose tho
"I'm 45 and still get doubts about what I really want to do as a trade for the rest of my life. I guess at the end what we are all looking for is within us, we just need to know how to recognize it and take action:) My 2 cents."
"Finally, a way to let my customers get lost in my business *without* even walking through the door. Thanks, Matterport—now they’ll never leave… literally."
"Look what made you happy as a child, mine was, I loved playing beats on lockers. Know I am learning music and cannot be more happy. It can be subtle, just look back and within, you will surely find the answer!"
Robert Greene is completely creepy and I wish he’d go away.
Wish Andrew had let Robert talk more.
"I think this is one of the most valuable videos on YouTube almost ever, which is obviously a ridiculous thing to say, but honestly, knowing what grain you should be following could change this world beyond measure. Imagine if more people were happy with their job or career and didn't beat their kids or piss everyone off in traffic just cause they hate their life and they take it out on everyone else? More content people = more content people, I would guess?"
"Half way through this video I had to stop it, and designed a questionnaire for finding purpose, based off of an assignment from uni of guided questions to recall old memories (explanation below). I work with youth athletes now so its more designed for that age, I don't know how it translates, but if anyone reads this and is interested in giving it a try, hit me up with a reply. It's free, I'm not selling anything, and it would actually be helpful for me as well to get feedback.

Although I'm upset at the time I lost without purpose, I must at least be thankful that at 40 I finally found it, or rather Jesus led me to it. This video reminded me of of an assignment in uni for Voice in theatre. It was a series of guided questions designed to evoke old memories of when I became conscious of my own voice and how it affected me. It really had a significant impact, and all it took was some guided focus, and a time limit to prevent overthinking"
"Many would say that I'm still young, but I know time is passing every day. I'm not happy where I currently am and know I'm wasting my potential while I sit here unsure of myself.

I love potential and opportunities, but eventually all things end and choosing one path closes off another. I'm so scared that I'll make the wrong choices and not tap into my full potential and end up dying unsatisfied and unhappy without contributing to the world like I could, yet I'm not happy where I am now. I just hope I make myself and my loved ones proud in the future and live a good life with whatever time I have."
You and I will find what we are searching for. Stop worrying and start telling yourself you will change.
"As soon as clients clearly understand what they truly want, the problem is halfway solved. 

Often, we think we know our desires, but sometimes what we chase isn't what we actually need. 

For example, a client of mine wanted a peaceful and calm environment but unknowingly chose stressful tasks because they believed more money would bring tranquility—even though they already had enough. It's important to align our goals with our true needs."
Love this guy

"I am 23 years old and my childhood was 100% being controlled by my asian family till I was turning into 18 or 19 years old. Unluckily, I also dropped out of my university beause of covid19 and civil war in my country. I was feeling lost in those years and didn't even realize that I am losing my ways. After times, I am exploring for my purpose. I can feel that I am feeling something about my purpose. Wish me luck."
"😯Wow! I needed to hear this.  Glad the video was recommended, though I was not searching for it.😕🤔"
"Two of my favourite extremely knowledgeable people on the same PODCAST!!?



Yes please 🔥"
Am 57 and in dire need of direction but my will to live is fading away.
This is note taking material 💯.
"Love this conversation!
I’m 23 years old and i learned a lot about my self i kinda have some clear vision because i know what i like and what i dislike .. also i've been through depression and i've seen the bottom ... and i just start know what my purpose is i really hope i get it"
Almost 66 and I basically wasted my entire life.
"Is this how or why? There's a bunch of context, but zero hints or exercises on how to discover your own things that drive you."
6:18 really hit me. This is exactly what happened when I was in my 20's.
Long live Robert Greene ❤️
❤❤❤
thank god for bringing Huberman to the world
this is dope for science lovers
"I hate that the only thing I liked as a kid was dancing 💀 now I'm 26 and I really dont care about it. If I were to make it a career at this point, I'd end up starving because I didn't develop my dancing skills and nowadays I'm very bad at it lmao."
"Robert, you are what I call a ""landscape genius."" You are able to see the ""glimmers,"" create a masterpiece, and tie all the loose ends together to create unique resonance. I love seeing people who remind me of my tribe. Since childhood, I always wake up when I see a fellow high functioning but gracious and elegant wing to others. Well done, you."
"I'm 18 and I'm lost, I don't know what to do with my life financially.  Ever since I left high School I've became lost as high school was always a stable place for me and when I lost that stable place and became an adult I don't know what to do. I want a stable good pain and easy job in other words, i want to be happy in my life but that's hard to find. Secondly I have really became AC and emotivated lately that I've reached the level where I have not worked a stable job or studied (because I dropped out of university) for one whole year. The only thing I do in my day is watch social media and eat and sleep and that's all. I am not proud of myself and I need to change because I see all these people becoming motivated and working lots of hours a week to achieve their dream of becoming financially free or getting their dream job and I am here just working at a fast food restaurant with no future ahead of me. Do you think about me is that I'm scared to take risks and I am scared to waste money time and energy on something that is not going to give me the results I want. Whenever I see something new that is coming up like joining e-commerce, affiliate marketing or creating content I do it for 2 hours then find something hard in my way and give up. I am lost and I need someone to help me because I want to be successful in life and retire early I don't want to be a nobody, I want to be able to live the life that I want and to be able to retire my parents at this stage I'm not going to have a good future ahead of me. I am seriously asking for advice from you guys please tell me what I should do because I have no idea what to do right now. I'm going to read every single comment to you guys do and seriously consider everything you suggest to me because I really want to change and have a good career path and stop being lazy."
"So this entire conversation can be summed up to ""do what you loved as a child"". I think everyone knows this."
I have read Mastery and watched so many of these videos. I have no clue what my passion/calling/interest is. I am 47 and I just want to not do anything. Nothing interests me. So what does someone like me do?
I enjoyed watching this today. Struggling to find my purpose and this has greatly helped
"Hi everyone, this is such an incredible and inspiring podcast. Moreover, I began to recall my childhood, some memories surfaced from my subconscious. I try to keep listening to my inner voice, but otherwise I get distracted by a lot of things, like wasting time on social media, browsing Instagram, and other things. It annoys me, it confuses me."
I think the best way to know yourself is to talk to your parents about your childhood
What happens when you did your dream job?
thank you so so much for this video 💝

🌊 Diverse Pathways: Embracing the idea that multiple paths can lead to fulfillment enables individuals to explore various options without the fear of being lost or making a wrong choice."
"Finding a purpose, or a talent, or a passion, is not that hard. You listen to yourself, try some new things, and see what happens. The real disappointment comes when you've found what you're good at (or great at) and luck (or God, depending on how you view the world) makes sure you can never build your life around that thing. He'll keep you working at a mundane task that anyone can do, and you have to struggle to do what you were CREATED for in your evening off hours, after you've given almost all your energy to the mundane job that keeps you alive. 

This is God's little joke on us in this world. He creates us with a soul, and with certain skills and advantages and tendencies, and then places us in a world where 99.999% of us cannot use those skills and characteristics to build our life down here. It's torture, really. It's like tying a dog to a chain and watching it run against the chain and come to a violent, jerking stop. 

Pretty soon, the dog gives up.

Don't be fooled by the ""success comes from hard work"" or ""here's what a millionaire does"" nonense. The fact is that only a very very small percentage of the world's people find a purpose and build their life on it. Life is a game of plinko. You work like a beast to get the chips, but where they fall is out of your control."
35 years old now. Been playing this character for 27 years. My 8 year old self was forgotten. Its been there waiting. At all cost i will bring him out.
"Damn Robert, I was here for 3 minute solutions lmao."
I would tell you to try reading The 21 Former Doctor Secrets by Rachel Morgan
DAMN I’m 42 and only just started on this journey … I’ve got work to do
"Spending the energy to find your ""purpose"" is a fallacy.  To suggest each of us 7+billion people on earth have a set purpose is silly.  Purpose is a construct of the mind.  It's your analytical mind trying to solve a problem that you created.  Life doesn't require purpose.  It just requires to be lived.  You are merely trapping your self by trying to find a purpose.  It's just another wall.   Finding a purpose is just another riddle your mind is trying to solve.   Just be, and just live."
Well I’m 46 😞 and pretty sad I have not done anything I wanted.
"I Know my purpose,,go preach ro someone else,,stay off youtube"
Im 31 still lost and feel empty please help me have a lifeee
It's great that the interview is not interrupted by annoying comparisons about the guest
I admire how DEEPLY you guys LISTEN with eachOTHER ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜 much appreciated and a wonderful interview ❤️
This is so good
"I had a situationship with a guy who is very high functioning autistic, he communicated with few words and mainly via other forms of communication. Facial, head and arm expressions, it has fast tracked my learning and understanding of non verbal communication."
Not everyone was obsessed with something particular when they were infants.
All of who you are is actually programing Robert bottom line. We are just Bio-computers!
"When I was like 18 i used to feel so alive, had drive and passion. I’m 23 now and being out here in adult life broke and disappointed with myself with the world, has just blown out my flame. I really want to change my life but I feel so incredibly burnt out and I’m stuck as a loser forever. I’m not good enough and it feels like I never will be. It sucks seeing everyone surpassing me and living life happy. It hasn’t gotten easier, things are only getting harder. I thought I knew my passions but I don’t really know anymore, being crap at the stuff I love most doesn’t help. At a certain point it all feels futile gamers"
I'm 58. I have already  lived my purpose. That purpose is over. How do I find a new one?
"I would say that the key to finding your happy destiny is to keep trying and searching. If you have a job but you are not happy, spend part of your salary on various courses, training sessions. Try a clay workshop, take a singing lesson, read a business book, learn how to repair a bicycle.
Look for that feeling that will bring you joy. Even if it was just as a hobby. It is never too late. Even after 70.
Also remember that if you find it, then it is natural to want to be the best at it. Competition arises. This is the moment when we can easily lose the joy of what we once loved. Don't compare yourself, learn from those who are better and teach those who need support."
If everyone found their purpose guess what???? No one would work. No one would have a job. No one would trust anyone. No one would be good. Lol. Only a few people get to find their purpose or else you wouldn’t even have your purpose at all. Think about it. A job is an easy way to see.
I imagine this is how Elliott Smith would have looked like right now if he was here.
The purpose of life is reproduction. This is true of all life.
The purpose of life is reproduction. You get to give life meaning though.
"This guy's books changed the way I see the human world around me and the way I operate within it. Thanks, Robert!"
What is the book he mentioned
"The one big get I got from this personally-
Thanks to rote educational systems I learned to hate learning from being forced to learn things I had no desire for."
"The purpose talked about is a Secondary purpose. We already have a Purpose- To Be Here Now! 
The purpose talked about is a choice  purpose NOT a given purpose. This gives relief and freedom- we need not find our purpose as it is already being done just by living."
You get to give life meaning though.
The purpose of life is the same for everyone and that is to reproduce.
Maintaining a marriage is the hardest job
I am opposed to the views of that person in the podcaat about finding insparition
Why does thie guy cry when he is talking?
so much tangible !!!!💙💙
I am 43 and I started to study for my dream job.
Very Awesome
"Turning 49yrs soon  feel.lost 
I need to find my purpose in life..feel stuck 😢"
I'd love more podcasts on this topic. I don't have that inner compass—I was not allowed as a child to dream or express myself.   How do I get on a fast track to discovering myself !?
"Summary:

Title: Finding Your Life's Purpose: A Journey of Self-Discovery

Introduction: The text discusses the complexities of being a human being in comparison to animals and the importance of finding one's unique purpose in life. It emphasizes the journey of self-discovery and connecting with one's inner voice to unlock true potential.

Summary:

    Being human comes with the challenge of navigating life without a set direction, unlike animals who instinctively follow their paths.
    Discovering one's life's task or purpose brings clarity, direction, and a sense of fulfillment.
    Each individual is born unique with innate talents and inclinations, which can serve as a source of power if embraced and honed.
    Howard Gardner's concept of five forms of intelligence highlights the importance of recognizing one's natural strengths and inclinations for finding a fulfilling career path.
    Society's influences, such as parental expectations and peer pressure, can drown out our inner voice over time, leading to feelings of confusion and aimlessness.
    Embracing one's true passion and emotional connection to a subject can enhance learning and productivity significantly.
    Finding one's purpose may not be an instant process but is achievable through self-reflection, introspection, and being open to exploring new possibilities.

Conclusion: Embracing one's uniqueness and passions, listening to internal impulses, and following the inner radar can lead to a fulfilling and purposeful life. The journey of self-discovery involves reconnecting with one's authentic self and aligning one's actions with their true desires to unlock personal growth and success."
This video makes me want to burst into tears.
Great one...thank you
"Such, such, such an amazing video. In Power of Human Nature he speaks about this"
Thank you Mr. Huberman - I really needed to hear this today - I am 69 and have been self employed successfully for 25 years. Downsizing now semi retiring - feeling lost before I listened to these wise words - will continue doing what I love being self employed but on a much slower and smarter basis - Thank you again for sharing your time with humanity - Namaste!
I like the story about French ( 7:00 apx.). Real life situations were the actual catalyst for learning. ! Thanks great video..
"About the uniqueness, what he wants to say? For example if I am unique at something, no one else will be as good as I am. Let's say someone has a beautiful voice and thousands of people also have a beautiful voice. What is the uniqueness then? Did not get it."
"The thing about 5 intelligences (or more) is a lie, they are not different intelligences how you suggest... they are aspects of the same thing. There is just intelligence and that's it."
"When I was seven I was memiroized by math, logic puzzles and learned coding. :D"
Thanks for the information
"As a fabrics technician and later fitter on the construction site i know my purpose.
But do you guys have at all a real purpose, what can you offer to me?"
Keep aiming for success in 2024❤🎉
47 and I am lost. Not only that but lost the ability to feel able to make good choices.

"For the most part that’s bs, no one’s inner child tells them to be a janitor or garbage man as their “passion”, and yet the world needs and have those careers.  Find what you’re good at, and your passion will develop, and you won’t be eating top ramen while doing it either"
"You don't have a purpose and you shouldn't!   God can do everything better than you.
You are free."
"Howard Gardener's book/theory changed my life - really helps cutting through the fluff and the things we try to hard to be good at.  If you have forgotten what you loved at 7 or 8 have a look around at the things that have been with you for the last 20, 30 50 years.......Some you want to be better at and some you are already skilled at.....Emotional engagement is def the key. Would def recommend Myers Briggs, its a good jumping off point, but don't get too carried away."
"I found this to be almost ... Worthless. Sorry I know it's good for some people but this was not really about actual purpose. But more feelings and coping skills, and happiness finding or something like that. ""Find the thing that you really enjoy doing and you won't not do it"". OK.  I know lots of people who did that and really enjoyed it. While they were doing but died empty. They never fulfilled their purpose.  Everyone seems to be chasing a ""feeling"" of purpose, (sense of purpose), not actual purpose.
This is just motivation tips when boiled down.  Which have their own value to be sure."
Purpose to become a better version of myself
"In an extremely difficult situation at this moment .. worked hard at every job , giving my 100 % , extremely professional hard working but now facing difficulties in office . Working from past 13 years , don’t know what type of curse that is but not even a single job I left like normal people. Happily , every time there is a politics involve to throw me out . I understand I am not social I am introvert and only focus on my work but idk what this is . Every job I have left is after arguments where I am not involved. Literally sobbing now."
i feel like me mental health issues prevented me from having a family how do i cope with ths?
Ephesians 1 and 2 in the bible have the answers... Plain and simple
"While listening to Robert sir, had many flashbacks and goosebumps about my past..We can't blame our parents they are victims too...I wish someone had been there to guide us better :)"
It just blows my mind. Thank you ❤❤
Idk but i hate it when people look down on others if they don't know what they want to do with their life like it's okay life is not all about finding a job and doing all the adult things sometimes we just want to live in a whatever way and just not jobs we are born in this World buts that doesn't mean we want to work and be a millionaire like other we have different mindset but that doesn't mean we can't think about all of those things we just don't want to bcz we don't feel like
"This administration has no idea how people are suffering, things are getting so much harder we can't take it no more. A lot of people are financially struggling to put food on the table and a roof over their head, I appreciate your advice Walter James Henry. Imagine I invested $2,000 and got $10,600."
"I seriously work hard to engage myself in someway of earning more income. My family are happy once again and can now afford anything for my family even with my Retirement.$57k k weekly returns has been life changing, after so much struggles."
"If you wanna be successful, you most take responsibility for your emotions, not place the blame on others. In addition to make you feel more guilty about your faults, pointing the finger at others will only serve to increase your sense of personal accountability. There's always a risk in every investment, yet people still invest and succeed. You must look outward if you wanna be successful in life>>"
It's hard!
"Gentlemen,
Your conversation resonates with my entire soul!  I am a 49 almost 50 year old individual who’s at a crossroad.
From since I began to learn myself, I knew what I liked; what made my heart and sprit leaped! 
My childhood was traumatic so I’ve always liked things/people/experiences that reminded me that life is indeed wonderful and lovely. Somehow, it has always felt that there are other humans doing the most to steer me in a different path. In other words, the spaces where life have led me thus far, has not aided in the mastery of my passion. Life has not allowed me the opportunities to revel in what I believe is my life’s path.  Life however, has seemed to have forcefully dragged me in spaces where a piece of my soul was chopped.  And like you said in your perfect apology about animals; amphibians not realizing their abilities to live/breath on both land and water.  The great tragedy is when they know their power however, circumstances/people are blocking them from stepping onto their true calling.

I am in a very disturbed place right now, both personally and professionally.  And I am scared about my life ending and me not being able to realize my potential.  I am also suck/cornered. I feel like a bird who’s wings are cut; like someone have their boots on my neck and I am unable to move. I feel trapped. I feel cornered and I am so, so concerned. I am doing my best to control my emotions/thoughts to not make any rash move/decision. I need a clear head. I need to think. And I know that God is with me.  It seem like life is truly trying to break and finish me but I am believing for a comeback.  I look forward to telling somebody someday how My God reached down, plucked me out of the devil’s grip and rescued me."
I've searched for an inspiring purpose from 16 to 60. Tried all these techniques. None of them worked. Maybe some people don't have a purpose and so they should stop worrying about it.
"I was lost struggling with life. A friend told me to read a book! No book thought would help. I finally did and it changed my life.   It’s called “Purposehood —Transform Your Life, Transform the World”. Step by step."
"This is so wrong in so many ways... Not everyone grew up in a family where they developed a sense of what they liked as the environment might have been scary or strict. So no voices there to hear... The fact that our DNA is unique (homozygotique  twins aside) why is that power? It's just a small difference. How utterly stressful it is  to hear that ""wasting"" your ""statistical uniqueness is a terrible thing.  And how immature to base what to do in your adult life according to your childhood self. Some people do and good for them. Not for everyone.."

"You need plants in that room. Bring some life and clean the air. Otherwise thank you for this, I too am struggling to connect with my 6-7yr old. I had very: let’s just say physically strict parents and was told what to like, love and hate. Wasn’t until my 30s I followed my heart. But only now am I just feeling my purpose trying to come out."
Before i watch all of it does he give good advice?

"man, I don't remember anything when I was 4-7 years old, except that I loved reading travel books, but I was never obsessed over anything."
"My child hood I was never drawn to anything as I was numbing with my self with video games to escape the bad home I lived in. Never had anything as a kid, just trying to numb. 

I guess my purpose is spending the rest of my life trying to find that “thing”. Sigh life is fun isn’t it?"
"Жизнь пуста и холоста, / пока вы не откроете сердца"
Just because you are able to find a job you’re good at and passionate about doesn’t mean you’ll feel fulfilled if it doesn’t pay you enough to live comfortably. You have to be realistic at the same time. Your job doesn’t need to be your main source of passion and fulfillment. I’d rather work a job I can tolerate that pays me well than one I love and I struggle to pay the bills. You can find purpose in your hobbies and relationships with others not just in your career.

I don’t know what I want in a job/career. I do know that I want financial stability, job security, & a growing field that will still matter 25 years from now."

I feel very lucky to have been able to find my purpose very early. As I grow I see more and more people who feel lost and my gratitude grows.
I imagine Robert’s The Art of Seduction has been a seminal read for Andrew.

Im a teenager with no life's purpose. Can someone please help me before I do something I don't want to do?
This was very informative and inspiring. Thanks for sharing!

Anyone know which mastery book he’s talking about?
I'm obsessed with number all my life
"Homie layin the ""you're one of a kind"" on me hit different"
Great talk!
What about a abused child? How to figure it out then?
Finally a great interview with Angus Young
"I don't necessary agree with hating math. I also hated math, but when I learned science, especially biology, that is when I start to appreciate math. Also, the reason why we often hate math is the way we taught math. 

If math is the language of the universe, we need to teach it intuitively. I was watching a video about Lemurians and Lemuria (ancient civilization?), and how they emphasized on right brain thinking. If we look at our current education system, we are left brain trained. Shouldn't we teach be teaching whole brain development in the 21st Century now??? 🤔😳🤓"
What happened to Dr. Huberman don't see he's videos anymore
"I regularly listen to the words from coaches “you are unique”, but I was almost bursted in tears when I’ve heard this on first minutes of this video!! It is something ❤"
So insightful!
"I'm mid life, and I have been feeling pretty much at a loss for what to do with myself, navigating internal conflict; healing from a pretty traumatic upbringing and still haven't figured out my 'life's task' (except for a love for nature and becoming a horticulturist, obtaining an official diploma document only to realize I cant do it forever, also health care) thinking about what to do next alot of my waking life and feel so grateful for the time I've been able to spend just healing and listening and learning about self-optimation / self love practices. yet here still, with this incessant need to make money for some reason...I have decided to do something practical, & discipline inducing, & feel with enough determination/ dunno about 'swimming with the current' but I hope to hell I feel a sense of success & accomplishment when I get there."
Thanks!
One of the best clips I’ve ever watched ❤
Thanks a lot. Great interview.
"The hardest part of finding your purpose is being with people who dont understand what that means. Maybe its because of the chatter in their own minds, intellectual growth or even understanding and comprehension of finding their ikigai. does that make sense?"
Love both these guys ❤
Thanks
Reading near the halfway mark of the Laws of Human Nature. His storytelling is succinct and sublime. Recommend that book and Mastery to all of you.
What a beautiful talk
So tired of hearing “Einstein” referenced as the “famous Physicist” 🙄.  Great marketing team that guy 😂
"It’s a little sad that he stated right off the bat that we are born with no direction. Maybe he was (or others were) because sometimes parents/family are not what they are all cracked up to be, but they also can be very supportive and directive. Believe it or not there are people like that in the world. It’s a pretty short sighted view."
God is the best way to find your purpose. If you truly believe you don’t need to be so narcissistic.
"My purpose was to play games and understand the theory of them. Sadly, I was not able to make a career out of it."

"I'm 67 and still confused. I can go back and pinpoint when I was a child what I wanted to do, but not having parents who listen or teachers/counselors at school who don't care set us up for failure. So sad."
Love Robert Green. So much to learn from him. Read most of his books. Makes you understand yourself and others
"If you can find a/your purpose then that's great. But why are we assuming that there IS a specific purpose for EVERYONE? I don't see any reason why this should be so. All the people who simply go to work to get the job done and get money (ie. 99% of people throughout history), perhaps raise kids, are reasonably content and then die without ever ''finding a purpose'' - maybe that was the best way for those people to move through life. The majority of people have no ''passions'' in any meaningful sense of the word."
Everything is absolute shit without Jesus
"To anyone who – like me – fell for the clickbait title and left hanging: This is HOW you actually find your purpose (some actionable steps). 

1. Find holes. 
Do your ikigai (a double-vendiagram, consisting of things you love, you’re good at, you get paid for and the world is in need for that you can provide). This will help discover what you‘re lacking and what „holes“ are in your happiness. 

2. Find the thing.
What do you see in the world that breaks your heart? Got some things? Good. Now flip it! What can you do about it and aid in making it better? In this stage, DON‘T think about limiting factors. There will be time for those. But start with POSITIVE factors only. (Want to be a tornado hunter in Kansas – but can‘t leave your dog at home? Get to that LATER! Stay with why you like tornados first.)

3. double-check
Is it actually your purpose? Find out by checking for „flow“: Do you forget time when doing „the thing“? Does it GIVE you energy, instead of draining you? 

This should be a good start. 
If anyone in the internet actually cares about this comment, I’ll gladly share some sources/books/people that helped me ACTUALLY find my purpose."
"I feel as though I have found my life's purpose, I wrote my first children's book during the pandemic, I hired an illustrator and worked with an editor to get it to a standard I'm really proud of. Then I hit a wall...supply chain, business development, PR, sales strategy 😑I find all these things so complicated. Whereas the creative side of things, I find myself in a flow, I alreday have three other stories started, all of which interlink. But the business side of things makes me question whether this truly is my purpose."
Great clip ✨
Timing 💪
"""It's not an intellectual thing, it's visceral, it's emotional, it's physical.""

""You feel that things are easy, everything clicks together, there's a delight.""

""Energy and motivation can come from either pressure, desire for something or desire to get away from something."""
Really great show !!!!!
"Psychologists will tell us that we can create for ourselves a feeling (or sense) of having a purpose.  But is a life spent chasing a feeling amount to a life worth living?   What if I could convince myself that used chewing gum wrappers have great worth.  Would that make it true?  No, worth is determined by a purpose that fills a need within a realm.  It implies a plan or design and we're part of that plan/design."
"I generated a prompt using gpt about the power of celebacy, i told it to write in the style of teacher Robert, and it was the most amazing prompt ever generated by AI for me.

Love this episode.
Life has no purpose.
"Some very good insights in this clip. I find it to be much more difficult to find the new path your life needs to go later in life.  Many distractions through the years.  Makes  sense to look back to when you were young, when our likes and feelings were natural. 
I also agree somethings moves us good or bad , to let us know we need to change direction or our course.
We can only hope to achieve the feeling that we are swimming on course. Great clip"
Love this 👏🏻
We are all born as a blank page......we go from there and we CAN be in control of our destiny.
